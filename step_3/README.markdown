Chapter 3, Step 3
=================

This step's example code has no CSS; it is intentionally stripped down and basic as a starting point for supporting older phones. It uses accesskey attributes on links and has converted the body of the page to be a tabular layout instead of floated <divs>. Note also that we are now using the XHTML-Basic 1.1 doctype.

There are some errors (i.e. things are in invalid) in this markup, which we'll be fixing in step 4.
