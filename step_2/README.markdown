Chapter 3, Step 2
=================

The only difference in the code between this step and step 1 is that there is a different doctypeâ€”in this case, we're using XHTML-Mobile Profile 1.2.

*Note:* To aid in code management, this example shares CSS with step 1. This means, technically, that there is an additional difference between this example and step 1: the href attribute on the <link> tag for the stylesheet is different.
